## Usage

To use DataLineagePy, follow these simple steps:

1. **Import the Library**:

   ```python
   import datalineage
   ```

2. **Load Your DataFrame**:

   Load your pandas DataFrame as you normally would.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')
   ```

3. **Track Lineage**:

   Call the lineage tracking function to start monitoring your DataFrame.

   ```python
   lineage = datalineage.track(df)
   ```

4. **Detect Anomalies**:

   Use the anomaly detection feature to find any irregularities in your data.

   ```python
   anomalies = datalineage.detect_anomalies(df)
   ```

5. **Check Compliance**:

   Ensure your data practices meet enterprise standards.

   ```python
   compliance = datalineage.check_compliance(df)
   ```

## How It Works

DataLineagePy operates by integrating seamlessly with pandas DataFrames. It captures metadata and tracks changes in real-time. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its core components:

- **Data Capture**: The tool monitors changes in your DataFrames, capturing important metadata.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Machine learning algorithms analyze your data to identify unusual patterns.
- **Compliance Checks**: Built-in features ensure that your data practices align with enterprise compliance standards.

### Architecture

The architecture of DataLineagePy consists of several layers:

1. **Data Layer**: Interacts directly with pandas DataFrames.
2. **Logic Layer**: Implements the core tracking and anomaly detection algorithms.
3. **Presentation Layer**: Provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the tool.

### Data Flow

1. **Input**: Users provide a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Processing**: The tool processes the DataFrame, tracking lineage and detecting anomalies.
3. **Output**: Users receive reports and insights based on their data.
